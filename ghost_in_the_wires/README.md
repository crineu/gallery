# Ghost in the Wires

Kevin Mitnick's Ghost in the Wires codes solved.

Props to the help of my [English] and [Polish] friends.

## Installation

A simple

```sh
shell> bundle install
```
does the job. Only **rake** and **minitest** required.

Nothing to be seen here.

## Tests

Everything runs with a
```sh
shell> rake
```
command. They should all pass.

I hope so.

We hope so.
