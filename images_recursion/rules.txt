1. Develop a set of classes for recursively scanning a directory, its subdirectories and included 
image files (GIF and JPEG). The sizes, dimensions and compressions rates are to be computed 
and stored (in memory) for all directories and picture files. For directories it must be possible 
to compute the sum of the file sizes in the directory and its subdirectories, the average image 
dimensions and average compression rates.
The information about the directories and files must be available after a single scan of the 
directory structure, without scanning the file system or accessing the files each time the 
information is needed.
It should be easy to use the resulting classes for the development of a directory analysis tool, 
which uses a tree to visualize the file hierarchy, allows the user to navigate through it and 
shows the information about the files and directories he selects. But the development of 
such a tool is not part of this test.
The  information about given directories and files should be printed to the console by a 
simple test program as shown in the appendix (see Exercise: Java “Image” Processing). The 
appendix also contains a test class to visualize the possibility to scan image files
